The benchmarks were run using a 5-minute timeout - using a longer timeout will give fewer incomplete executions.\r\n\r\nIn the container, run `batch_run.py` after activating the virtualenv. Results are in `results.json` once the benchmark completes.\r\n\r\nThe benchmarks take a long time and a *lot* of RAM in any but the largest of clusters, beware.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark Results\r\n\r\n| Bug             | Occurrences |\r\n| --------------- | :---------- |\r\n| Callstack Bug   | 4792        |\r\n| Reentrancy      | 3742        |\r\n| Time Dependancy | 165         |\r\n| Concurrency     | 490         |\r\n| Total           | 11839       |\r\n| (Timeout)       | 5715        |\r\n\r\n*The results are different from those in the paper. This is an improved version of the tool, with fewer exceptions.* \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n1. solc and disasm from [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)\r\n2. [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases) Theorem Prover\r\n\r\n## Evaluating Ethereum Contracts\r\n\r\n```python oyente.py <contract filename>```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! Run ```python oyente.py --help``` for a list of options.\r\n\r\n## Paper\r\n\r\nThe accompanying paper explaining the bugs detected by the tool can be found [here](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~loiluu/papers/oyente.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous Utilities\r\n\r\nA collection of the utilities that were developed for the paper are in `Misc_Utils`. Use them at your own risk - they have mostly been disposable.\r\n\r\n1. `generate-graphs.py` - Contains a number of functions to get statistics from contracts.\r\n2. `get_source.py` - The *get_contract_code* function can be used to retrieve contract source from [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io)\r\n3. `transaction_scrape.py` - Contains functions to retrieve up-to-date transaction information for a particular contract.\r\n\r\n#### Known Issues\r\nIf you encounter the `unhashable instance` error, please add the following to your `class AstRef(Z3PPObject):` in `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/z3.py`:\r\n```\r\ndef __hash__(self):\r\n        return self.hash()\r\n```\r\nThe latest version of Z3 does support this, but some previous version does not.\r\n",
